<h2 id="the-main-rule">The Main Rule</h2>
<p>Roll a die when the result of an action is uncertain. If the result is equal to or greater than the target number, you succeed.</p>

<p>You have three <strong>stats: Strength, Dexterity, and Willpower.</strong></p>
<p>Roll a die for each stat, in order. The result is your <strong>ability score</strong> for that stat. When trying to do something related to one of your stats, use <code>7 minus that stat</code> as the difficulty.</p>
<p>Start with basic clothes, $5, and a weapon.</p>
<p>Your character can be hit three times before they die. Be careful!</p>
<h3 id="optional-character-classes">Optional: Character Classes</h3>
<p>If you want, you can choose a class for your character. This lets them do some extra stuff, but also gives you a weakness. Being “weak” to a damage type makes that type of attack count as two hits.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fighters</strong> get an extra attack, but are weak to magic damage.</li>
<li><strong>Specialists</strong> can pick locks, but are weak to all damage.</li>
<li><strong>Mages</strong> can cast spells, but are weak to physical damage.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="magic">Magic</h2>
<p>Mages and many monsters have the ability to cast spells. To cast a spell, say what it is going to do, and then make a Willpower roll. If the roll is successful the spell is cast as intended, but if it fails you take a hit. <em>If you roll a 1 on a spell roll, you are permanently unable to cast spells again except with a scroll or other magical item.</em></p>
<p>All characters are able to cast spells from scrolls, but the spell effect must be whatever is written on the scroll. Scrolls are single-use only.</p>
